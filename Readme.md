# Code Repository Readme

This repository contains the code for a basic arithmetic operations application, which consists of the following files and directories:

```
├── arithmetic
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── operations.py
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── Dockerfile
```

## Description

The code in this repository demonstrates a simple arithmetic operations application. It consists of a Python package named "arithmetic" that contains the necessary functions for performing basic arithmetic calculations. The package includes an `__init__.py` file to make it a Python package and an `operations.py` file that implements the arithmetic operations.

The `main.py` file serves as the entry point of the application. It imports the functions from the `arithmetic` package and showcases how they can be used to perform arithmetic calculations.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install these dependencies using the following command:

  ```shell
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

To run the arithmetic operations application, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have satisfied the prerequisites mentioned above.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the repository code.
4. Execute the following command:

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

   This will run the `main.py` script and showcase the arithmetic calculations using the functions from the `arithmetic` package.

## Docker Containerization

This code repository includes a `Dockerfile` that enables containerization of the arithmetic operations application. With Docker installed on your system, you can build a Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile` and run the application within a container.

To build and run the Docker image, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the repository code.
4. Build the Docker image using the following command:

   ```shell
   docker build -t arithmetic-app .
   ```

5. Once the image is built, you can run the application within a Docker container using the following command:

   ```shell
   docker run arithmetic-app
   ```

   This will start the container and execute the arithmetic operations application.
